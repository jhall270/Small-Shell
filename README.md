# Small Shell

### Description

This program is a shell application, with functionality similar to a simplified bash shell.  It was created for an assignment in my operating systems course.  It supports several built-in commands and additional commands from the linux environment.  When receiving a command, the program forks off a new process which executes the command.  The '&' operator can optionally be used to execute the command in the background.
